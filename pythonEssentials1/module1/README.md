*Created: May 24, 2025*

---

## Overview
Module 1 introduces you to the world of programming and the Python language. You’ll learn the fundamental concepts of computer programming and get hands-on experience setting up and running Python code. This module lays the groundwork for your journey into Python development.

## Objectives
- Understand the basics of computer programming.
- Explore Python’s role as a versatile programming language.
- Set up your Python runtime environment.
- Write and run your first Python program.

## Topics Covered
- **What is Programming?**: The process of giving instructions to a computer.
- **Python Overview**: History, features, and applications of Python.
- **Environment Setup**:
  - Installing Python (3.8 or higher).
  - Configuring a text editor or IDE (e.g., VS Code, PyCharm).
  - Running Python in the terminal (e.g., `python --version`).
- **Your First Program**:
  - Writing a simple “Hello, World!” program.
  - Running code: `python hello.py`.
- **Basic Syntax**: Understanding Python’s structure and conventions.

## Getting Started
1. **Install Python**: Download from [python.org](https://www.python.org) and verify with `python --version`.
2. **Choose an Editor**: Use `nano`, `vim`, or a GUI editor like VS Code.
3. **Try It**:
   - Create a file: `nano hello.py`.
   - Add: `print("Hello, World!")`.
   - Save and run: `python hello.py`.
4. **Explore**: Check the `module1/` folder for example code and exercises.

## Why This Matters
This module builds the foundation for all subsequent learning. By understanding programming concepts and Python’s basics, you’ll be ready to tackle more complex topics like variables, loops, and functions.

## Next Steps
- Complete the exercises in the `module1/` folder.
- Proceed to [Module 2](../module2/README.md) to learn about data types and basic operations.
