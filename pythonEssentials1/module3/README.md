# Python Essentials 1 - Module 3: Boolean Values, Conditionals, Loops, Lists, and Operations

*Created: May 28, 2025*

---

## Overview
Module 3 introduces Boolean values, conditional execution, loops, lists, and logical/bitwise operations. Youâ€™ll learn to make decisions, repeat tasks, manipulate lists, and perform operations, building skills for dynamic Python programs.

## Objectives
- Understand Boolean values and relational operators.
- Implement conditional execution with `if`, `if-else`, `if-elif-else`.
- Use `while` and `for` loops for repetition.
- Work with lists (indexing, slicing, manipulation).
- Apply logical and bitwise operations.
- Sort lists using bubble sort.
- Explore multidimensional lists.

## Topics Covered
- **Boolean Values and Relational Operators**:
  - Values: `True`, `False`.
  - Operators: `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`.
  - Example: `print(5 > 3)` outputs `True`.

## Getting Started
1. **Set Up**: Ensure Python (3.8 or higher) and an editor (e.g., VS Code, nano).
2. **Try It**:
   - Create a file: `nano basics/boolean_relational.py`.
   - Example code:
     ```python
     x = 5
     y = 3
     print(x > y)  # Outputs True
     ```
   - Run: `python3 basics/boolean_relational.py`.
3. **Explore**: Check `module_3/basics/` for scripts.

## Why This Matters
Boolean values and operators enable decision-making and control flow, foundational for programming logic and dynamic applications.

## Next Steps
- Complete exercises in `module_3/`.
- Proceed to conditionals, loops, lists, and operations.
