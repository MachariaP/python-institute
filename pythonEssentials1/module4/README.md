# Python Essentials 1 - Module 4: Functions, Data Structures, and Exceptions

*Created: May 24, 2025*

---

## Overview
Module 4 focuses on creating reusable code, working with advanced data structures, and handling errors. Youâ€™ll learn to write functions, use tuples and dictionaries, process data, and manage exceptions to build robust Python programs.

## Objectives
- Create and use functions for modular code.
- Work with tuples, dictionaries, and data processing techniques.
- Handle errors using exception handling.

## Topics Covered
- **Functions**:
  - Defining functions with `def`.
  - Parameters, return values, and scope.
  - Lambda functions and recursion.
- **Tuples**:
  - Immutable sequences (e.g., `my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)`).
  - Tuple unpacking and use cases.
- **Dictionaries**:
  - Key-value pairs (e.g., `my_dict = {"name": "Alice", "age": 25}`).
  - Dictionary methods: `get()`, `keys()`, `values()`, etc.
- **Exceptions**:
  - Handling errors with `try`, `except`, `finally`.
  - Raising exceptions with `raise`.
- **Data Processing**:
  - Reading/writing files.
  - Processing data with loops and comprehensions.

## Getting Started
1. **Set Up**: Ensure Python and your editor are ready.
2. **Try It**:
   - Create a file: `nano functions.py`.
   - Example code:
     ```python
     def greet(name):
         return f"Hello, {name}!"
     try:
         name = input("Enter your name: ")
         print(greet(name))
     except ValueError:
         print("Invalid input!")
     ```
   - Run: `python functions.py`.
3. **Explore**: Check the `module4/` folder for example code and exercises.

## Why This Matters
Functions, advanced data structures, and exception handling enable you to write modular, efficient, and error-resistant programs. These skills are essential for real-world applications like web development and data analysis.

## Next Steps
- Complete the exercises in the `module4/` folder.
- Explore advanced Python topics or frameworks like Django to build on your skills.
