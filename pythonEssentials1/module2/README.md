# Python Essentials 1 - Module 2: Data Types, Variables, and Basic Operations

*Created: May 24, 2025*

---

## Overview
Module 2 dives into the building blocks of Python programming: data types, variables, and basic operations. You’ll learn how to store and manipulate data, perform input/output operations, and use operators to build simple programs.

## Objectives
- Understand Python’s core data types and variables.
- Perform basic input/output operations.
- Use operators for calculations and data manipulation.

## Topics Covered
- **Data Types**:
  - Integers (`int`), floating-point numbers (`float`), strings (`str`).
  - Type checking with `type()`.
- **Variables**:
  - Declaring and assigning variables (e.g., `x = 10`).
  - Naming conventions and best practices.
- **Input/Output**:
  - Reading input with `input()`.
  - Displaying output with `print()`.
- **Basic Operators**:
  - Arithmetic: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `//`, `%`, `**`.
  - Comparison: `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`.
  - Assignment: `=`, `+=`, `-=`, etc.

## Getting Started
1. **Set Up**: Ensure Python is installed and you have a text editor.
2. **Try It**:
   - Create a file: `nano calculator.py`.
   - Example code:
     ```python
     name = input("Enter your name: ")
     age = int(input("Enter your age: "))
     print(f"Hello, {name}! You are {age} years old.")
     ```
   - Run: `python calculator.py`.
3. **Explore**: Check the `module2/` folder for example code and exercises.

## Why This Matters
Mastering data types, variables, and operators is essential for writing functional Python programs. These skills enable you to process user input and perform calculations, forming the basis for more advanced programming.

## Next Steps
- Complete the exercises in the `module2/` folder.
- Proceed to [Module 3](../module3/README.md) to explore control structures and lists.
